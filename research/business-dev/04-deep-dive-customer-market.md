## Why This Matters

A bespoke builder with no customers is just a person with tools. Everything we build in the configurator, every workflow we design, every financial model we create — it all exists to serve the person who wants a garden building. Understanding how customers find you, decide to buy from you, and feel about the experience afterwards is what makes the difference between a hobby and a business.

## 1. Sales Management

### What It Is
The process of turning interested people into paying customers. For a bespoke builder, this is deeply personal — it's not a checkout page, it's a relationship.

### The Sales Funnel — Applied to Garden Buildings

The classic funnel, reimagined for Andrew's business:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │    AWARENESS         │  "I want a garden building"
                    │  Google, Instagram,  │  Hundreds of people

### The Configurator as Sales Tool

This is the insight that most competitors miss. The 3D configurator isn't just a product page — it's a **sales qualification engine**:

1. **Self-qualification** — Customers who spend 10 minutes configuring a shed are MUCH more serious than someone who just browses a gallery
2. **Spec capture** — When they enquire, you already know exactly what they want (dimensions, roof type, doors, windows, cladding)
3. **Price anchoring** — If the configurator shows estimated pricing, the customer arrives at the conversation already expecting the right ballpark
4. **Emotional investment** — They've designed "their" building. It's personal now. Harder to walk away.
5. **Shareable** — They can send the link to their partner: "look what I designed for the garden"

**No other garden building company in the UK has this.** They have image galleries and "request a quote" forms. Andrew has a tool that lets customers fall in love with their building before they even make contact.

### Sales Metrics That Matter

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Lead response time** | How fast you respond to an enquiry | Studies show responding within 5 minutes = 21x more likely to qualify |
| **Conversion rate** | Enquiries → quotes → orders | Where are you losing people? |
| **Average order value** | Revenue per job | Are you selling enough per customer? |
| **Quote win rate** | Quotes sent ÷ quotes accepted | If low, either pricing or qualification is wrong |
| **Customer acquisition cost** | Marketing spend ÷ new customers | How much does each customer cost to find? |
| **Time to close** | Days from first contact to order | How long is the decision cycle? |

### The "Good Enough" Sales Process for a Small Builder

You don't need Salesforce. You need:
1. **Know who's enquired** — name, contact, what they want, when
2. **Don't forget to follow up** — reminders, not just hoping they'll call back
3. **Know where each prospect is** — browsing / enquired / quoted / deciding / ordered / building
4. **Learn from losses** — why did they say no? Too expensive? Wrong fit? Too slow?

## 2. Marketing Management

### What It Is
Getting the right people to discover you in the first place. For a bespoke builder, this is about being findable, credible, and memorable.

### Marketing Channels for a Garden Building Business

| Channel | Effort | Cost | Effectiveness | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|--------------|-------|
| **Google Search (SEO)** | High (ongoing) | Low (time only) | Very high | "bespoke garden building [area]" — the money keyword |
| **Google Ads (PPC)** | Medium | £5-20/click | High for targeted terms | Expensive but immediate |
| **Instagram** | Medium | Low | High for visual products | Before/after, build progress, finished work |
| **Facebook** | Low-Medium | Low-Medium | Moderate | Local groups, marketplace |
| **Word of mouth** | Zero | Zero | Highest conversion | Happy customers → referrals. The gold standard. |
| **Portfolio/website** | High initially | Low ongoing | Essential | The configurator IS the portfolio |
| **Local directories** | Low | Low-Free | Moderate | Checkatrade, Bark, MyBuilder |
| **Print/local** | Low | Medium | Low but targeted | Parish magazines, garden centres |

### Content Marketing — What to Create

For a bespoke builder, content should demonstrate **expertise and craftsmanship**:
- Build process videos (time-lapse)
- Before/after photos
- "How we built..." case studies
- Planning permission guides
- Material guides ("Why Douglas Fir?")
- Seasonal maintenance tips
- Configurator walkthroughs

**The configurator itself is content marketing.** Every visitor who plays with it is engaging with Andrew's expertise in a way that a brochure never achieves.

## 3. Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

### What It Is
Systematically tracking every interaction with every customer and prospect, from first contact to years after delivery.

### Why CRM Matters for a Bespoke Builder

A bespoke building is a significant purchase (£5k-£30k+). The sales cycle is long (weeks to months). Customers research, compare, worry, ask questions, change their minds, come back. Without a system, conversations fall through cracks:

- "Didn't they email me about their shed last month? What did they want?"
- "I was supposed to follow up with that couple after their holiday"
- "Did I ever send that revised quote?"

### What a Builder's CRM Actually Needs

Forget Salesforce's 500-field contact records. A builder needs:

**Per Customer:**
- Name, phone, email, address
- How they found you (Google? Referral? Instagram?)
- What they want (configurator link / spec)
- Every conversation (notes, not transcripts)
- Status: prospect / quoted / ordered / building / complete / advocate
- Any photos of their site
- Follow-up reminders

**Per Interaction:**
- Date
- What was discussed
- What was promised
- Next action + date

**That's it.** A CRM for a bespoke builder shouldn't look like Salesforce. It should feel like a smart address book with a timeline.

### CRM Connecting to Everything Else

```
CRM contact ─────→ linked to configurator session (what they designed)
     │
     ├────→ linked to quote (what we quoted them)
     │
     ├────→ linked to job (when ordered)
     │
     ├────→ linked to payments (deposits, invoices, receipts)
     │
     ├────→ linked to schedule (when we're building)
     │
     └────→ linked to follow-up (warranty, reviews, referrals)
```

This is where the universal business OS shows its power. A customer isn't just a CRM entry — they're a thread running through sales, operations, finance, and delivery.

## 4. Product Management

### What It Is
Deciding what to build (the range), for whom (the market), at what price, and how to evolve it over time.

### Product Decisions for a Garden Building Business

| Decision | Options | How to Decide |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **What types?** | Sheds, workshops, offices, gazebos, cabins, studios | Customer demand data from configurator |
| **What sizes?** | Small (8x6) to large (20x12) | Most popular configurations from analytics |
| **What materials?** | Douglas fir, treated softwood, composite, steel | Cost/quality/demand balance |
| **What features?** | Insulation, electrics, skylights, bi-fold doors | Upsell opportunities vs complexity |
| **What price range?** | Budget (£2-5k), mid (£5-12k), premium (£12k+) | Market positioning — where do you compete? |

### The Configurator as Product Intelligence

Every session in the configurator is **product research data**:
- What sizes do people configure most?
- What roof types?
- What cladding?
- Where do they abandon (too expensive? too complex?)
- What features do they add most?

This data is gold for product management. No need for surveys or focus groups — the configurator IS the focus group, running 24/7.

## What This Means for Our Universal Business OS

### Key Insights

1. **The configurator IS the top of the funnel.** No other tool in the market does this. The system must treat configurator sessions as lead-generation events — capture the data, track the journey.

2. **CRM should feel invisible, not like "doing CRM."** Andrew shouldn't have to "update the CRM." When he responds to an enquiry, the system should naturally capture it. When a quote is sent, it's automatically linked. When a job completes, the customer status updates. **CRM should be a byproduct of doing business, not a separate activity.**

3. **The customer is the thread that connects everything.** In the discipline landscape (doc 01), we mapped 43 disciplines. The CUSTOMER is the entity that weaves through sales, operations, finance, delivery, and follow-up. The universal data model should centre on the customer-job relationship.

4. **Marketing analytics can come from the configurator itself.** What people configure = what they want. This is first-party data that doesn't require cookies, surveys, or guesswork.

5. **Follow-up is where most small businesses fail.** Not because they don't care, but because they're busy building. Automated reminders ("You quoted Mrs. Smith 7 days ago — follow up?") are simple but transformative.

### Architecture Principle: Customer as Central Entity

```
                         CUSTOMER
                        /    |    \
                       /     |     \
              Configurator  Jobs   Payments
              sessions      │      │
                │           │      │
              Quotes     Workflow  Invoices
                │        stages    │
              Follow-ups    │    Cash flow
                         Schedule
```

The Solution Planner's data model should make the Customer the central node. Everything else — jobs, quotes, payments, schedules, configurator sessions — connects through them. This is what makes a CRM feel invisible: you're not "doing CRM," you're just... running your business, and the customer data accumulates naturally.
