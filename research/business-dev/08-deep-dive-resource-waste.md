# 08 — Deep Dive: Resource Management & Waste

*"Am I being efficient?" — the disciplines that eliminate waste and maximise the value of everything you have.*

Covers: Resource Management, Waste Management (Materials + Time), Asset Management, Knowledge Management, Data/BI

---

## Andrew's Insight: "Waste isn't just waste material. It's also wasted time."

This reframing is fundamental. Traditional waste management in construction focuses on physical waste — offcuts, packaging, broken materials. But for a solo builder, the more devastating waste is **time waste**: admin that doesn't add value, searching for information, redoing work, waiting, travelling unnecessarily. Time is the finite resource.

## 1. The Eight Wastes (Lean Framework, Extended)

Toyota's seven wastes + Andrew's eighth, applied to a garden building business:

| # | Waste Type | Physical Example | Time/Knowledge Example |
|---|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Overproduction** | Cutting timber before confirming spec changes | Generating quotes for unqualified leads |
| 2 | **Waiting** | Waiting for concrete to cure, materials to arrive | Waiting for customer to decide, planning dept to respond |
| 3 | **Transport** | Trips to merchant, moving materials around workshop | Emailing documents back and forth, file hunting |
| 4 | **Over-processing** | Finishing hidden surfaces, over-engineering | Creating beautiful quotes for tyre-kickers, over-documenting |
| 5 | **Inventory** | Excess timber, unused fittings | Unprocessed emails, unfinished tasks, information overload |
| 6 | **Motion** | Walking between workshop and van, searching for tools | Switching between apps, re-entering data, manual calculations |
| 7 | **Defects** | Mis-cuts, wrong dimensions, rework | Errors in quotes, wrong information sent to suppliers |
| 8 | **Wasted talent/time** | Skilled builder doing admin | Andrew doing data entry when the system should do it automatically |

### The Business OS as Waste Eliminator

Each system feature should be measured against: **"Does this eliminate a waste?"**

| Feature | Waste It Eliminates |
|---------|-------------------|
| Configurator → BOM → auto-quote | #4 (over-processing), #6 (motion), #7 (defects), #8 (wasted talent) |
| CRM with auto-tracking | #5 (inventory of unprocessed leads), #6 (motion), #2 (waiting) |
| Job-driven procurement | #1 (overproduction), #5 (inventory excess), #3 (transport) |
| Quality checklists from spec | #7 (defects), #4 (over-processing) |
| Cash flow forecast | #2 (waiting for money insight), #7 (cash management defects) |
| Workflow engine | #2 (waiting — shows what's blocking), #6 (motion — automates handoffs) |

## 2. Resource Management

### What It Is
Optimising the use of ALL resources — people, materials, time, money, equipment, knowledge.

### The Five Resources of a Small Builder

| Resource | Scarcity | Key Question |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Time** | Most scarce — there's only one Andrew | "Am I spending time on the highest-value activities?" |
| **Money** | Constrained — cash flow matters | "Is every pound deployed where it gets the best return?" |
| **Materials** | Variable — supply chain dependent | "Am I buying the right amounts at the right time?" |
| **Equipment** | Fixed — tools, van, workshop | "Is my equipment up to the job? What needs replacing?" |
| **Knowledge** | Growing — experience accumulates | "Am I capturing what I learn? Can others access it?" |

### Time — The Primary Resource

For a solo builder, time allocation is THE strategic question:

| Activity | Value | Question |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Building on site** | Highest — this is revenue-generating | How to maximise days on site? |
| **Quoting** | High — leads to revenue | How to make quoting faster? (Configurator!) |
| **Customer communication** | High — builds trust, prevents issues | How to be responsive without constant interruption? |
| **Procurement** | Medium — necessary but not revenue-generating | Can ordering be more efficient? Batch orders? |
| **Admin** | Low — but necessary | How to minimise? Automation? |
| **Travel** | Low — dead time | Can site visits and deliveries be combined? |
| **Marketing** | Variable — depends on pipeline | Only when pipeline is thin |
| **Rework** | Negative value — waste | Eliminate through better planning and quality |

**The system should help Andrew see where his time goes** — even rough categorisation (building, admin, travel, quoting) reveals patterns and waste.

## 3. Asset Management

### What It Is
Tracking and maintaining physical assets — tools, equipment, vehicles.

### What a Builder Owns

| Asset Category | Examples | Tracking Needs |
|----------------|---------|---------------|
| **Vehicle** | Van | MOT date, service schedule, fuel costs, insurance |
| **Power tools** | Circular saw, drill, nail gun, planer | PAT testing dates, maintenance, replacement value |
| **Hand tools** | Chisels, hammers, squares, levels | Location (workshop? van? left on site?) |
| **Safety equipment** | Scaffolding, ladders, harnesses | Inspection dates (scaffolding requires regular inspection) |
| **Workshop equipment** | Workbench, dust extraction, racking | Maintenance schedule |
| **Technology** | Laptop, phone, camera | Backup schedule, software licences |

### What the System Needs
- Simple asset register (what do you own?)
- Maintenance/inspection due dates with alerts
- Insurance values for each asset
- Optional: cost tracking (fuel, repairs) for business vehicles

---

## 4. Knowledge Management

### What It Is
Capturing, organising, and making accessible the knowledge that exists in people's heads.

### Why This Is Critical for Andrew's Business

Andrew's knowledge is the business's most valuable and most vulnerable asset:
- How to build a hipped roof on a garden building
- Which timber sections work for which spans
- How to detail a Douglas fir corner joint
- What to check when foundations are on clay soil
- Which building regs apply to which scenarios

**If this knowledge only exists in Andrew's head:**
- He can't delegate effectively
- He can't scale the business
- He can't create Forge AI training content
- If he's injured or ill, the business stops

### Where Knowledge Gets Captured in Our System

| Knowledge Type | Where It Lives |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Construction knowledge** | Encoded in the configurator (correct geometry, timber sections, stud spacing) |
| **Process knowledge** | Workflow templates (how to build a shed from start to finish) |
| **Quality knowledge** | Quality checklists (what to check at each stage) |
| **Customer knowledge** | CRM (preferences, history, communication) |
| **Financial knowledge** | Job costing data (what things actually cost) |
| **Supplier knowledge** | Supplier records (who's reliable, what they charge, lead times) |
| **Decision knowledge** | Memory files, decision logs (why we chose X over Y) |

**The universal business OS IS a knowledge management system** — it captures knowledge as a byproduct of doing business, not as a separate activity. This is the same principle as "invisible CRM."

## 5. Data & Business Intelligence

### What It Is
Turning raw data into insights that drive better decisions.

### What Data the System Should Surface

| Insight | Data Source | Decision It Enables |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| "Most popular building type" | Configurator analytics | Product focus, marketing |
| "Average profit margin per job" | Job costing | Pricing, go/no-go on similar jobs |
| "Average time from enquiry to order" | CRM + workflow | Sales process improvement |
| "Most common waste type" | Waste tracking | Process improvement |
| "Supplier with best/worst lead times" | Procurement records | Supplier selection |
| "Time allocation this month" | Time tracking | Where is effort going? |
| "Cash position in 30 days" | Cash flow forecast | Take on new work? Pay bills? |
| "Customer acquisition cost" | Marketing spend ÷ new customers | Marketing ROI |

### BI Should Be Automatic, Not a Project

Don't build a "BI dashboard" that requires configuration. The data should surface naturally:
- Open the Today view → see this quarter's OKR progress
- Open a job → see estimated vs actual cost
- Open the financial lens → see cash flow forecast
- Open the efficiency lens → see waste trends

**Every view IS a business intelligence view** when the data is connected.

## What This Means for Our Universal Business OS

### Key Insights

1. **"Am I being efficient?" should show the 8 wastes visually.** Not as a Lean training exercise, but as practical data: time spent on admin vs building, material waste per job, rework frequency, travel time. Make waste visible and it gets reduced.

2. **Time tracking should be effortless.** "I spent today on the Smith job" — one tap. Not 15-minute timesheet increments. The system can infer most of it from the workflow (job moved to "building" stage → time is allocated there).

3. **Knowledge management IS the system.** Don't add a "knowledge base" — the workflow templates, quality checklists, configurator data, job history, and decision logs collectively ARE the knowledge base.

4. **Every view is a BI view.** Don't create a separate "analytics" section. Embed insights everywhere: show profit margin when you open a job, show conversion rate when you look at leads, show waste trends when you view completed jobs.

5. **Asset management can be dead simple.** A list of tools with next-service dates and insurance values. That's enough for a small builder. Make it a checklist, not a database.
