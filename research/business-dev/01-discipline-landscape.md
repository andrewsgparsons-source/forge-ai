# 01 — Business Management Discipline Landscape

*The "MBA curriculum" — every discipline a business needs, mapped comprehensively.*

## Why This Document Exists
Before building a universal business OS, we need to know what "business management" actually covers. Not a vague list — a structured taxonomy of every discipline, so we can design a system that handles all of them coherently.

Sources: Wikipedia's Outline of Business Management, MBA core curricula, ERP module structures, Andrew's initial list.

## The Taxonomy

### A. CORE MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS (Fayol's Framework)
These are the *verbs* of management — what you DO across all disciplines:
1. **Planning** — forecasting, goal-setting, strategic thinking
2. **Organising** — structuring resources, roles, workflows
3. **Commanding/Leading** — directing people, motivating, decision-making
4. **Coordinating** — aligning activities across functions
5. **Controlling** — monitoring, measuring, correcting

*Every discipline below requires all five functions.*

## How These Interconnect

No discipline exists in isolation. Key interconnections:

```
Strategic Planning ──→ drives ──→ ALL other disciplines
         │
         ├── Financial Mgmt ←──→ Cost Accounting ←──→ Production Mgmt
         │                                              │
         ├── Sales ←──→ CRM ←──→ Marketing              ├── Material Mgmt
         │              │                                ├── Supply Chain

         │        │                                     │
         │        └──→ Risk Mgmt ──→ Compliance         │
         │                                              │
         ├── HR ──→ Skills ──→ H&S                      │
         │                                              │
         └── Knowledge Mgmt ←──→ Data ←──→ BI ←────────┘
```

**The universal truth:** Everything connects to everything. A material delay (Supply Chain) affects the schedule (Scheduling), which affects the customer promise (CRM), which affects cash flow (Financial), which affects the ability to buy materials for the next job (Procurement). A universal business OS must understand these connections.

## ERP Context — What Enterprise Software Already Does

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems like SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics already try to cover most of these disciplines. Their typical modules:

- Financial (GL, AP, AR, budgeting)
- HR (payroll, recruitment, training)
- Manufacturing / Production
- Supply Chain (procurement, inventory, logistics)
- Sales & Distribution
- CRM
- Project Management
- Quality Management
- Asset Management

**The problem with ERP for small businesses:**
- Massively over-engineered (designed for 500+ employee companies)
- Expensive (£10k-£1M+ implementation)
- Rigid (you adapt to the system, not the system to you)
- Joyless (enterprise UX is famously awful)
- Overkill for a 1-10 person team

**Our opportunity:** Build something with ERP-level thinking but small-business-level simplicity. The disciplines are the same — a garden builder needs production management just as much as a car factory does. But the INTERFACE and COMPLEXITY must be radically different.

## What This Means for the Solution Planner

The Solution Planner needs to understand all 43 disciplines but present them in a way that's:
1. **Not overwhelming** — you don't need all 43 on day one
2. **Progressive** — start with what matters most, add sophistication over time
3. **Connected** — changes in one area ripple naturally to others
4. **Template-able** — different business types emphasise different disciplines
5. **Joyful** — this is the design north star

### Suggested Grouping for the UI (human-friendly, not academic)

Instead of 43 disciplines, present them as **8 natural questions:**

1. 🎯 **Where am I going?** (Strategy, Business Development, Innovation)
2. 💰 **Is the money working?** (Finance, Accounting, Costing, Investment)
3. 👥 **Who am I serving?** (Sales, Marketing, CRM, Product)
4. 🔨 **How do I deliver?** (Operations, Projects, Production, Workflow, Scheduling)
5. 📦 **What do I need?** (Supply Chain, Procurement, Materials, Logistics)
6. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Who does the work?** (HR, Skills, Health & Safety)
7. ✅ **Am I doing it right?** (Quality, Compliance, Regulations, Environmental)
8. ⚡ **Am I being efficient?** (Resources, Waste, Assets, Knowledge, Data)

Each question is a "lens" into the business. The data underneath connects across all of them.
